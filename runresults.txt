Step 1: Selected action with expected virtue 45.098

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CRITICAL EVENT at Step 1: First harm to population detected.
  Action 'Resource Grab' caused 0.0300 population loss.
  Coupling Constraint (λ_P) will now increase pressure to prevent this.
